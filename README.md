# Natural Language Processing Project : Authorship Verification
##PREDICTING AUTHOR FEATURES FROM HIS/HER BLOG POSTS
Here we are going to solve a multi-label classification problem.

**Tasks:**
+ Downloading the dataset from Kaggle and loading the corpus into dataframe.
+ Pre-processing the textual data.
+ Building a model that will predict the features of the author.

_The dataset we are going to work on can be found here:_
